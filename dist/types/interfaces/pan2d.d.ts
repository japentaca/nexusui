/**
 * Pan2D
 *
 * @description Interface for moving a sound around an array of speakers. Speaker locations can be customized. The interface calculates the closeness of the sound source to each speaker and returns that distance as a numeric value.
 *
 * @demo <span nexus-ui="pan2D"></span>
 *
 * @example
 * var pan2d = new Nexus.Pan2d('#target')
 *
 * @example
 * var pan2d = new Nexus.Pan2D('#target',{
 *   'size': [200,200],
 *   'range': 0.5,  // detection radius of each speaker
 *   'mode': 'absolute',   // 'absolute' or 'relative' sound movement
 *   'speakers': [  // the speaker [x,y] positions
 *       [0.5,0.2],
 *       [0.75,0.25],
 *       [0.8,0.5],
 *       [0.75,0.75],
 *       [0.5,0.8],
 *       [0.25,0.75]
 *       [0.2,0.5],
 *       [0.25,0.25]
 *   ]
 * })
 *
 * @output
 * change
 * Fires any time the "source" node's position changes. <br>
 * The event data is an array of the amplitudes (0-1), representing the level of each speaker (as calculated by its distance to the audio source).
 *
 * @outputexample
 * pan2d.on('change',function(v) {
 *   console.log(v);
 * })
